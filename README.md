My Keyboards
============

This is the repo with the custom keyboard layouts I have designed to order from wasdkeyboards.com.

It contains:

- My original colemak layout
- An unmodified wasd template file from late 2015

A general feature, I tend to add to my own layouts is additional anchor points for text on the keys.

I have noticed that the preview looks a little odd, but the actual files in inkscape looks a lot better.
